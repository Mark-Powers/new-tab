# New Tab
My new tab landing page

Features links to my most popular sites, with a config for any sites that are self hosted (as to not link to my own) and to hide some personal information.

The weather and a 3 day forecast is also displayed.

# Set up
Host the files on a web server. Rename `template-config.js` to `config.js`, and fill in the values as needed.

# TO DO
- Update weather at most once per hour
- Style forecast table better
- Show green/red status indicator for sites (also to update on the hour)
